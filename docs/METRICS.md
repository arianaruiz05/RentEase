## Metric 1 - Happiness 
NPS (Net Promoter Score)

Implement survery from FlutterFlow marketplace. This survery will pop up after the user logs in for the 5th time. The user will see this survey on the the general listings page for students/landlords at the end of the Golden Path with data recorded in the database for that user.

## Metric 2 - Engagement
Clicks Per Listing

When a user clicks on a property listing to view more details, this event is logged in Firebase Analytics. The data is stored in the database, allowing us to track the number of clicks for each property listing. The click-through rate (CTR) for each listing can be calculated by dividing the number of clicks for that listing by the total number of times that listing was viewed or displayed.

## Metric 3 - Adoption
Registration Rate

When a user successfully signs up for an account (as a new user), this action is logged as an event in Firebase Analytics. The data is stored in the database, allowing us to track the number of users who attempt to sign up and how many successfully complete the process.

## Metric 4 - Retention



## Metric 5 - Task Success
Student Paired with Roommate Success

Checking to see how many students that are looking for roommates find a roommate through our roommate preference survey

## Metric 6 - Task Success Part 2
Search to Contact Conversion Rate

Track user interactions using Firebase Analytics. When a user performs a property search and clicks the "Contact" button to reach out to a property owner, these events are logged. The data is stored in the database, allowing us to calculate the conversion rate by dividing the number of contact initiations by the total number of searches.
