## Metric 1 - Happiness 
NPS (Net Promoter Score)

Implement survery from FlutterFlow marketplace. This survery will pop up after the user logs in for the 5th time. The user will see this survey on the the general listings page for students/landlords at the end of the Golden Path with data recorded in the database for that user.

## Metric 2 - Engagement


## Metric 3 - Adoption
Registration Rate

When a user successfully signs up for an account (as a new user), this action is logged as an event in Firebase Analytics. The data is stored in the database, allowing us to track the number of users who attempt to sign up and how many successfully complete the process.

## Metric 4 - Retention



## Metric 5 - Task Success


## Metric 6 - Task Success Part 2
Search to Contact Conversion Rate

Track user interactions using Firebase Analytics. When a user performs a property search and clicks the "Contact" button to reach out to a property owner, these events are logged. The data is stored in the database, allowing us to calculate the conversion rate by dividing the number of contact initiations by the total number of searches.
